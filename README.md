# Uber-Clone Full-Stack Project:
This project involves the creation of a fully functional ride-sharing web application modeled after Uber. The platform connects riders with drivers for seamless transportation services. The application offers features like real-time ride tracking, user profiles, fare estimates, payment processing, and driver-rider matching, all with a clean, responsive design optimized for both desktop and mobile users.

Technologies Used:

Frontend:

React.js: Used to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces, including ride request forms, driver availability status, and notifications.
TypeScript: For type-safe development and better code quality.
Tailwind CSS: For a customizable and responsive design, ensuring the app is user-friendly on all devices.
JavaScript: Used for frontend logic, including event handling and dynamic content updates.
Backend:

Node.js with Express: The backend server built with Node.js, providing APIs to manage ride requests, user profiles, driver availability, and payments.
Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Used for hosting, computing resources, and storage, ensuring scalability and performance.
Firebase or MongoDB: A NoSQL database to store user and ride-related data like profiles, ride history, ratings, and locations.
Real-time Features:

WebSocket/Socket.IO: Implemented for real-time ride tracking, driver status updates, and communication between riders and drivers.
Google Maps API: For displaying the location of rides, real-time tracking, and mapping the pickup and drop-off locations.
Payment Integration:

Stripe API: Integrated for secure in-app payment processing, allowing users to pay for rides using credit/debit cards, with automated fare calculation based on distance and time.
Authentication & Security:

JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For secure user authentication and authorization, ensuring only verified users can request or provide rides.
OAuth 2.0: Option to sign in with Google/Facebook for a seamless authentication process.
